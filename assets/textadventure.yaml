    You startle awake from a deep sleep. Why are you not
    in your bed? Instead, you find yourself sunny on a beach.
    Wearing your pyjamas...

    Something feels odd about all this. As if you were not really awake.

    East end of the beach

    There is a very high palm tree here and a lot of sand.
    A lot of sand.
    You see dense jungle to the north. East of you are sharp
    rocks. Better not go there. To the south is ocean which
    stretches to the horizon. The sandy beach goes on to the
    west.

    No way you are going in there!
