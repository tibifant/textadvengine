    Finally the sandy shore is interruped, by a somewhat goopy and smelly tar pit.

    As you stumble through the dark guided by the flickering light of your torch. You reach a little cavity where the path forks in two directions: One to the north, one to the west.
    You're surprised by the fact that you've perfectly kept track of cardinal directions through such a long cave, but you're stuck in a dark cavity in your pyjamas holding a slithering makeshift torch, so it's best to not question your abilities at this exact point in time.
